            is critical both as a fundamental right and a strong device to wars promoting the
             wellbeing of children and their protection against all forms of violence and deprivation.

             regional and the national legal frameworks as well as scholarly articles acknowledge that the child’s registration immediately after birth guarantees the rights from birth to a name, nationality, family relations and all the related privileges<br></p>

    <h1>Problem statement</h1> 
    
    <p>Penalty for late registration after 30 days for a child born and 15 days for death register.<br>
      Late registration will be fined according to the new law, but this is not yet enforced; in case of dispute, a capable court’s decision will be required.  Any person wishing to receive a birth record but not having declared the child’s birth within the period provided for by the law is liable to an executive reasonably determined by an executive law.<br><br>
      Holidays of leaders, when a leader who is responsible to record children born are not around, is possible some people may miss in the record of a child born or dead person.<br>
      Children born with some infections and other problems such as low body mass, or other problems and this causes parents to stay in hospital until the child is fine.<br><br>
      The incorrect number of population growth. When people don’t register and unregister the country may get wrong statistics in population growth. In that way also some people delay registering and she or he doesn't want to give penalty fees. These people decide to stay with children who aren’t registered.<br><br>
      Loss of documents, and reduction of paperwork. In the registration of children born a long time ago, the sectors use paper or notebooks before entering those data in a database or record of the sector. So that culture is analogous because it is possible where the recorder to skip one record or wrote the wrong record.<br><br>

<p>The procedure of recording a child's birth is known as birth registration.
  <br> It establishes a legal record of where the child was born and who his or her parents are, at the very least.
   A child's birth certificate - his or her first legal proof of identity – requires birth registration.</p><br><br>
